NodeJs

* require http module 

* asynchronous work, callback based

* they use intellij webstorm & fiddler

* // What is Sela? Their nodejs course?

* nodemon?

* write response chunks immediately - dont write to a string and then write to disk (takes longer, writing the whole response at once)

* nodejs works with chunks, so it orks on smaller amounts of data more often- allows to release the thread quickly

* npm install express //install express



Connect Middleware

* pipeline which expands the nodejs httpServer
* server.use to add functionality

* query string - through url module.
